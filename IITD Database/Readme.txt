Description of the IITD Iris Image Database version 1.0

This iris image database mainly consists of the iris images collected from the students and staff at IIT Delhi, India. This database has been acquired in
the Biometrics Research Laboratory during January - July 2007 using JIRIS, JPC1000, digital CMOS camera. The acquired images were saved in bitmap format.
The database of 2240 images is acquired from 224 different users and made available freely to the researchers. All the subjects in the database are in the
age group 14-55 years comprising of 176 males and 48 females. The resolution of these images is 320 x 240 pixels and all these images were acquired in the
indoor environment. All the images in the database were acquired from the volunteers who were not paid or provided any honorarium. The images were acquired
using an automated program that requires users to present their eyes in a sequence until ten images are registered.
